This repository contains the project "Design of Digital 100-Base-TX Ethernet Receiver System" done during the course Digital Communication at the University of Windsor in winter 2018.

The objective of this project is to design the Digital 100-Base TX Ethernet Receiver System. A binary sequence as input signal is generated from the source. Through sampler, filter, equalizer and decision device, the output signal is distributed on three levels
by three symbols. Additional methods are outlined that slicer reduces the impact of error propagation and alleviates intersymbol interferences (ISI), and time recovery adjusts sampling phase to achieve symbol synchronization.

The design part of this project was to create a simple decision feedback slicer and a timing recovery function using MATLAB. The findings were the output from the transceiver system distributed into three symbol levels and symbol synchronization with less dispersion.
