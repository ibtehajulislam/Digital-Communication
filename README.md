# Digital-Communication
This repository contains the project "Design of Digital 100-Base-TX Ethernet Receiver System" done during the course Digital Communication at the University of Windsor.
A group project that simulates the transmission and receiving of 100Mbps binary data with a digital transceiver system.The design part of this project was to create a simple decision feedback slicer and a timing recovery function using MATLAB. The slicer reduces the impact of error propagation and inter symbol interference (ISI). Additionally, the timing recovery adjusts the sampling phase to achieve symbol synchronization. The findings were the output from the transceiver system distributed into three symbol levels and symbol synchronization with less dispersion.
